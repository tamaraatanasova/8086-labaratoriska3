# 8086-labaratoriska3

Write a program segment that will compare 2 strings, one of which is
password. Both strings should be entered in memory locations as desired. The comparison is
it does byte by byte and if the strings are different it is printed on the user screen
'N', and if they are the same, write 'D'. To check the operation of the program, so that for
password, the word 'MPSPOTPISI' will be entered, and for the second string the words:
'MICROPOTPISI'; 'MPSPOTPISI'; 'MPSPOTPIS', for three consecutive executions.

**Subject**

Microcomputer's systems

**Built With**

This project is built using the following tools:

- [Emu8086](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/): Assembler and emulator for the Intel 8086 microprocessor.

**Getting Started**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

**Prerequisites**

In order to run this project you need:

A working computer
Connection to internet
Setup

**How to Run**

To run the program, you need an 8086 emulator or assembler. You can use emulators like DOSBox or TASM (Turbo Assembler). Here's how to run the program using EMU8086:

1. Download and install Emu8086 from [here](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open Emu8086 and load the `palindrome.asm` file.
4. Assemble the code by pressing the Assemble button.
5. Run the program by pressing the Run button or by pressing F10.
